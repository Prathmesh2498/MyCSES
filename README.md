# MyCSES
I have recently started solving CSES problem set. The goal is get good at problem solving not necessarily preparing for CP competetions.  

compile.ps1 and newProb.ps1 are Windows Powershell utilities to compile and create problems because I am coding on Windows for some reason :P.

Template.cpp is read by newProb.ps1.

Usage:

 > .\compile.ps1 -ProgramName Name_of_file
 
 > .\newProb.ps1 -ProgramName Name_of_file

Feel free to use and/or modify the templates as required!
